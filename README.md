# Final-Project
This is a text based adventure game based on Assignment8

The project will have  a user, 15 areas, offensive weapons, healing items, a car, and a cure which the user must get to a lab in order to beat the game.  It will demonstrate my knowledge of structs, classes, linked lists, vectors, recursive functions, pointers, and file and i/0 streams
